# Bootstrap-Vue Template

This is a simple template for projects using
bootstrap-vue + sass. It's got all the redundant
stuff removed and proper dependencies sorted out.
It uses sass for styling (see `src/assets/_custom.scss`).

npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
